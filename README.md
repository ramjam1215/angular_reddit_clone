I was kind of lazy on this assignment, i actually finished it when we were assigned the first 30 or so pages from our reading in the ng-book a few weeks back. It was nice to have a "tutorial" of sorts for angular, b/c I'm pretty new at web development.

Dislcaimer:
-The reason i don't have alot of commits is because i misinterepreted hw3's d2l information as a reason to not have to make a repository on git( i thought that putting some sample code from a book on my git was trivial, but i learned alot so i feel like a jerk now)
Totally understand if i get points of for the lack of commits.

I finished the tutorial and also did the extra credit(favorite part of the assignment).

Extra Credit/Angular Revelation haha
- I pushed the article array to my service so that my components just asked for or relayed the information from the service when input was received from the users. Essentially the components just pass information between the user and the application. I'm excited to get more advanced. But, we can put alot of this new information to good use when thinking about more Object-Oriented development when working on the web.
